# CVE-2018-12794



Type Confusion vulnerability, xfa.form` and `xfa.template`.

Though ZDI posted a blog to analyze this bug, *but I do not think the blog is clear enough, I will post an another blog about this bug. :)* Some data structure is hard to analyze :(  black box is so hard, but I am working on it :)
